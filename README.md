# SpaceTimeDensities
Code for calculation of space time densities from a set of movement trajectories

Implementation of the algorithm from the following paper:

Demsar U, Buchin K, van Loon EE and Shamoun-Baranes J, 2015, Stacked space-time densities: a geovisualisation approach to explore 
dynamics of space use over time. GeoInformatica, 19(1):85-115.

Code is provided in R. The main file is StackedSpaceTimeDensities.R, which also contains on brief description on how to run the code on the provided test dataset. Note that you will need volumetric visualisation software to display the results (e.g. Voxler or ParaView).
